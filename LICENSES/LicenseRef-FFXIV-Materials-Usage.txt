General Guidelines

These guidelines apply to any and all use of the Materials:

* You may not use the Materials for any sales or commercial use, meaning you cannot receive license fees or advertising revenue, except as part of the partner programs operated by YouTube, Twitch, or similar programs. If the operator of a partner program seeks to confirm our policy, please point them to this page as we do not have the resources to respond to all requests. As an exception, this restriction against commercial use will not be enforced against influencers for earning revenue or wages from corporate entities through the streaming of gameplay.
* If you use a trademark (such as "Final Fantasy" or any related logo), then you must include a notice saying that the mark is owned by Square Enix, such as the following:

    FINAL FANTASY is a registered trademark of Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd.

* If you use any copyrighted Materials (such as screenshots or gameplay video), then you must include the following notice:

    © SQUARE ENIX

* You may either use © SQUARE ENIX or the copyright text as it is shown in-game. Ex. © SQUARE ENIX CO., LTD. All rights reserved.
* You may not sell the Materials to third parties as original content;
* You may not use the Materials to promote other commercial products;
* You may not materially alter or modify the Materials, except:
  * You may add your own voice-over, and you may edit, combine, mash-up, mix and match the Materials with other FFXIV Materials;

* You must immediately comply with any request by Square Enix to remove any Materials, in Square Enix's sole discretion;
* You agree not to use any Materials in conjunction with any of the following: unapproved Square Enix assets; counterfeit merchandise; pornography; unlicensed Square Enix music available for streaming or download, or links to unlicensed Square Enix music available for streaming or download.
* In relation to any functions within the game which allow you to perform virtual musical instruments (“performance actions”), you are strictly prohibited from performing the music of any third parties. You hereby warrant that your performance using the performance actions will not infringe the rights of any third parties and you shall indemnify us in respect of any breach of such warranty. You may record and share your performance of the FINAL FANTASY XIV original score or original songs and/or melodies using the performance actions in accordance with this Agreement. Furthermore, by using the performance actions, you acknowledge and consent to any third party recording and sharing of your performance online. You also hereby agree that we may block or otherwise restrict your access to FFXIV if you do not comply with the terms of the license contained herein.


Guidelines for Videos

* The video must not require a paid membership for viewing;
* You may not split our videos (vocal, music, visual, etc.) or distribute components as separate assets;
* You may not combine or synchronize the Materials with third party content (e.g., a mash-up); but you may include the Materials alongside third party content (e.g., before or after in the same video) as long as you also have permission from the original copyright owner);
* The video must not contain racist, sexist, homophobic or generally offensive content of any kind. This includes graphic violence or sexually explicit content.


Guidelines for Music and Sounds

* You may only use music as it is incorporated in FFXIV;

* You may not play FFXIV music alone (i.e., without accompanying gameplay footage), or with third party materials;

Take-down Notices

Square Enix ("Company") has adopted the following general policy toward copyright infringement in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/legislation/dmca.pdf"). The address of the Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement ("Designated Agent") is listed at the end of this policy.

Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringement:
If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through Company's websites or services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;
* Identification of works or materials being infringed;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Company is capable of finding and verifying its existence;
* Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address;
* A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

If we receive a takedown notice in accordance with the foregoing, we will remove the material cited in the notice and attempt to notify any user who uploaded the allegedly infringing material if we have their contact information. Any such user will have the opportunity to submit a “counter-notice” as set forth below. If we determine that any user has repeatedly infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, we will disable any accounts that user has with us when appropriate.

Procedure to Deliver Counter-Notice:
If any user believes any material removed is either not infringing or that such user has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, the user must send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed below:

* A physical or electronic signature of the user;
* Identification of the material that has been removed and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed;
* A statement that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed as a result of mistake or a misidentification of the material; and
* The user's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the user's address is located, or if the user's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company will forward a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Company may restore the removed material following 10 days. The original complaining party will then have 10 days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material. If Company does not receive any such notification within 10 days, we may restore the material, at our discretion. Please contact the Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement for Company at Attn: DMCA Agent, Legal Department, 999 N. Pacific Coast Highway, 3rd Floor, El Segundo, California 90245, United States of America.
